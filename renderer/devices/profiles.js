 * Every device this app knows how to talk to.

 *  - layout "chain" (Zoom MS Plus): a reorderable effect chain, serialised as
 *    a patch blob. Consumes ZoomDevice's patch/effect API (currentPatch,
 *    setEffectParameterForCurrentPatch, downloadCurrentPatch, ...).
 *  - layout "fixed-panel" (Bass POD Pro): a fixed signal path where every
 *    control is its own live MIDI CC. Consumes BassPodProDevice's CC API
 *    (setParameter, addParameterChangedListener, ...).
 *
 * They share only the lifecycle contract below (open/close/isOpen/deviceName/
 * addOpenCloseListener) plus `layout`, which tells app.js which view to build.
 * Forcing one interface over both would mean inventing patch semantics the POD
 * doesn't have (or hiding live CCs the Zoom pedals don't have), so the split
 * is deliberate - each adapter exposes what its hardware actually speaks.
